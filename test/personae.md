# People who use minicomp

* **Trace**: A harried RA graduate student in English who simply wants things
  done. Trace is mostly following orders from the PI, Filomena, and has nearly
no experience with the command line.

* **Filomena**: The PI on a project that for some reason is tied to minicomp.
  Only interested in the god view.

* **Mabel**: A graduate student in History looking to build a project sticking
  to the tenets of Minimal Computing. Mabel wants to not only do, but learn.
She is our favorite user real talk.

* **London**: A developer in a university library with minicomp foisted upon
  him in resentment. Distrusts the results and wants to be able to check
whatâ€™s going on in some easy way and extend at will. Maybe also patch into
other frameworks.
